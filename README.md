# Lanthanum Injector

### Purpose ðŸŽ¯
This is my personal DLL injector which I plan on improving over time.
### Method ðŸ’‰
The current injector executes my shellcode in the target process by hijacking a thread. This shellcode uses LoadLibraryW as of current.
### Features in progress
  * Simple bytepatching to avoid Steam's LoadLibrary hooks
  * Manual mapping
  * More cool stuff
### Credits (I'm sure this will expand)
adrian from public club - helped with shellcode
