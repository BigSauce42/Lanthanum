# Lanthanum Injector

### Purpose 🎯
This is my personal DLL injector which I plan on improving over time.
### Method 💉
The current injector executes my shellcode in the target process by hijacking a thread. This shellcode uses LoadLibraryW as of current.
### Features in progress
<ul>
  <li>Simple bytepatching to avoid Steam's LoadLibrary hooks</li>
  <li>Manual mapping</li>
  <li>More cool stuff</li>
</ul>
### Credits 🙏(I'm sure this will expand)
